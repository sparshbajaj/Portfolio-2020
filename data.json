I laid out the initial groundwork for what would be involved.</p><img src=\"https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200\" alt=\"Dummy image\"> <p>I created Help Scout Dark Mode (HSDM) to communicate this idea with the organization and engineers.</p> <img src=\"https://source.unsplash.com/random/400x200\" alt=\"Dummy image\"><p>I viewed dark mode more as a set of principles to follow, ones that would follow the visual language dictated by its lighter counterpart. This in turn lent itself to creating a more functional vision, where I looked at how a dark mode would work from a hierarchical viewpoint, along with a color mapping study of light to dark.</p>",
